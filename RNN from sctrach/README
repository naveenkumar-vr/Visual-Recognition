RNN from scratch

Observation:

Using ‘NaveenKumar_IMT2017029’ as the word
• Without bias the word was not produced even after 10000
iterations.
• With bias the word was produced within 350 iterations, also with
bias the change in loss is rapid.

2. Implementation details:

Used Adagrad method with adagrad epsilon = 1e-8 Observations:
Using ‘NaveenKumar_IMT2017029’ as the word and hidden size=8
• Using SGD, the word was produced in 350 iterations.
• Using the Adagrad method the word was produced within
200 iterations.

3. Observations:
• With hidden size = 8
The word was produced within 200 iterations. • With hidden size = 16
The word was produced within 100 iterations. • With hidden size = 24
The word was produced within 40 iterations. • With hidden size = 25
The word was produced within 30 iterations.

Any hidden size higher than this gives a similar result.
